# team_summary

# Pseudo

- when user runs application on command line - presented with a set of questions - Inquirer
- prompt user for info about the team manager and team members
  ** name/email/ID/role
  ** manager - office #
  ** engineer - github
  ** intern - school
- can input any number of members - mix of engineers and interns
<!-- * app must pass all unit tests - Jest -->
- once quesitons are answered - the app creates an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster

<!-- * DONE
** recommended to follow this workflow?
--- run test
--- create/update classes to pass a single test case
--- repeat -->
<!-- *** is this testing the class functions in the modules we create??? -->

\*\*\* In your HTML template files, you may want to add a placeholder character that helps your program identify where the dynamic markup begins and ends

EXAMPLES

<!-- --- once npm install - have jest
--- once you write code - then run test "npm run test"
<!-- --> runs test then tells you the results -->
<!-- --- want code to pass all the tests - then can run app.js/create it --> -->
